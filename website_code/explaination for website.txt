Certainly! Let's go through each part of the code and explain its purpose:

1. **HTML Structure**:
    - The HTML code provides the structure of the portfolio website. It consists of:
        - Header section containing the website title and navigation menu.
        - Sections for "About", "Projects", and "Contact".
        - Footer section.

2. **CSS Styling (styles.css)**:
    - Defines the styling rules for various elements of the website such as fonts, colors, layout, etc.
    - It includes styles for the header, navigation menu, sections, projects, and footer.
    - Also includes a media query for responsive design, which hides the navigation menu on small screens and displays a toggle button instead.

3. **JavaScript (script.js)**:
    - **Smooth Scrolling**:
        - The first part of the JavaScript code handles smooth scrolling when clicking on navigation links.
        - It selects all `<a>` elements with `href` attribute starting with `#` (internal links), and adds a click event listener to each.
        - When a link is clicked, it prevents the default behavior (i.e., jumping to the anchor) and scrolls smoothly to the corresponding section using `scrollIntoView()` method with `{ behavior: 'smooth' }` option.

    - **Responsive Navigation Menu**:
        - The second part deals with making the navigation menu responsive.
        - It selects the toggle button (`.nav-toggle`) and the navigation menu (`.nav-menu`) from the DOM.
        - Adds a click event listener to the toggle button.
        - When the toggle button is clicked, it toggles the `active` class on the navigation menu. This class controls the visibility of the navigation menu on small screens by showing or hiding it.

So, in summary, this code provides a basic structure for a portfolio website with smooth scrolling functionality and a responsive navigation menu. It enhances user experience by providing easy navigation and a visually appealing design.
